NOTICE (Updated October 15 2021):

If you maintain scripts used to access ftp.gnu.org over FTP,
we strongly encourage you to change them to use HTTPS instead.

Eventually we hope to shut down FTP protocol access, but plan
to give notice here and other places for several months ahead
of time.

There are several mirrors of this archive, a complete list can be
found on http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html.  You might want to use a
mirror closer to you.

Non-GNU programs that were formerly in gnu/ have moved to gnu/non-gnu/.
Most of them were just pointers in the format program.README.  If you
are looking for such a file, be sure to check gnu/non-gnu/.

Archives of the GNU mailing lists can be accessed or downloaded
via the web from http://mail.gnu.org; they are no longer available
by ftp.
